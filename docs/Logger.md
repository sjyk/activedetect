# ActiveDetect: Logging

ActiveDetect provides a composable library for error detection tailored for Machine Learning workflows. This documentation covers a basic overview of the concepts, components, and how to tune them.

##Logging

ActiveDetect provides a flexible API for logging and reporting. The basic Logging class is defined as:
```
def logError(self, error_object):
"""
Given a dict generated by an error dector, logs
"""

def logSchema(self, type_array):
"""
Given a dict generated by the type inference
"""


def logFileType(self, size, cols):
"""
Given a dict generated by the type inference
"""


def logConfig(self, module_array, config_array):
"""
Given a dict input to the detector
"""
```

Any sub-class that implements these methods is a Logger and can be passed into an ErrorDetector object:
```
detector.addLogger(...)
```

##CSVLogging
We provide one example class for logging which logs the data to a CSV file:
```
CSVLogging(filename)
```

To use this,
```
e = ErrorDetector(loadedData)

e.addLogger(CSVLogging("log.csv"))

e.fit()
```
